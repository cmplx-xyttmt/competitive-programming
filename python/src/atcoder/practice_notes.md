# Practice Notes
This document contains a "retrospective" view of my practice, starting from "practice_20". This is after a long break from competitive programming, and trying to get back into it.

## Practice 20
Setup a virtual contest on Kenkoo with 6 problems, only managed to solve 2 in 1.5 hrs :(.
Solve the other 4 in another virtual contest.
